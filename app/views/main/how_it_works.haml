The retail price you originally paid is not the same as the wholesale value of your piece. Like most assets, diamonds, once purchased, depreciate in value. However, some diamonds acquired many years ago may have increased in value. Should you decide to exchange your diamonds for cash, contact us and you will receive unmatched service from our trusted staff."
